This is a raw html-css-js app, u only need to open 'welcome.html'.

# How it works?

'load-character.js'

- Has a data array to simulate a JSON file.
- InnerHTML every single "img-wrapper" HTML element using data array.
- Add a click event to every "draggable-image" to generate a correct URL for 'another-view.html'.

'show-selected.js'

- Uses urlParam to show the corresponding character and his abilities.
- Has another data array because I can take the 'load-character.js' array because web browser policies.

'filters.js'

- Has some functions to filter data accord attributes like color-rarity-type-class and live search functionality.

'abilities.js'

- Has another data array only for abilities design and generate everything for that section.
